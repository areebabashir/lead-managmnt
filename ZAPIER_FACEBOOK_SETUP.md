## ðŸ”§ Customization Options

### Lead Assignment
By default, leads are assigned to the Super Admin user. To customize:

1. Modify the `receiveFacebookLead` function in `webhookController.js`
2. Change the assignment logic to assign to specific users based on:
   - Lead source
   - Geographic location
   - Campaign type
   - Round-robin assignment

### Lead Status and Priority
Default values:
- **Status**: `prospect`
- **Priority**: `medium`
- **Lead Type**: `new`

To customize, modify the webhook controller.

### Custom Fields
Facebook Lead Ads custom fields are automatically added as notes. To store them as separate fields:

1. Update the contact model to include custom field schemas
2. Modify the webhook controller to map custom fields

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test the Webhook Locally
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/webhooks/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}'
```

### Test Facebook Lead Webhook
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/webhooks/facebook-lead \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "lead_id": "test_123",
    "first_name": "Test",
    "last_name": "User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "phone_number": "+1234567890",
    "zapier_webhook_id": "test_zap"
  }'
```

## ðŸ“Š Lead Tracking

### View Facebook Leads
1. Go to the Leads page in your CRM
2. Filter by source: "facebook"
3. All Facebook leads will be marked with source "facebook"

### Lead Analytics
The system tracks:
- Lead source (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
- Campaign information
- Ad details
- Form information
- Creation timestamp
- Assignment information

## ðŸ”’ Security

### Webhook Security (Recommended)
For production, consider adding:
1. **API Key Authentication**: Add API key validation
2. **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict to Zapier IPs
3. **Signature Verification**: Verify webhook signatures
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse

### Example with API Key
```javascript
// In webhookController.js
const WEBHOOK_API_KEY = process.env.WEBHOOK_API_KEY;

export const receiveFacebookLead = async (req, res) => {
    // Verify API key
    const apiKey = req.headers['x-api-key'];
    if (apiKey !== WEBHOOK_API_KEY) {
        return res.status(401).json({
            success: false,
            message: 'Unauthorized'
        });
    }
    
    // ... rest of the function
};
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook not receiving data**
   - Check if the server is running
   - Verify the webhook URL is correct
   - Check Zapier logs for errors

2. **Leads not appearing in CRM**
   - Check server logs for errors
   - Verify database connection
   - Check if user assignment is working

3. **Duplicate leads**
   - The system checks for existing leads by email/phone and Facebook Lead ID
   - If duplicates still occur, check the duplicate detection logic

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Next Steps

1. **Set up Facebook Lead Ads** in your Facebook Ads Manager
2. **Create your Zap** in Zapier
3. **Test the integration** with a test lead
4. **Monitor the leads** in your CRM
5. **Customize** the integration based on your needs

## ðŸ†˜ Support
